Here's the 2 spreadsheets with our fish data and our event/water quality data. 
I also included what I had started with the microsporidia data.  

Ben, we had ancillary data re: fish kill and antecedant rainfall for the 2010 analysis that you ran.  
I don't remember what we did for those 2-- presume we just had a yes/no for fish kill event for the season prior.
